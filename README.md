# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Problem Statement

This project aims to solve a multi-class classification problem using a real-world dataset of 7,043 customers from a California-based telecommunications company during Q2 2022. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a single customer and includes information such as demographics, geographic location, tenure, service subscriptions, and customer status for the quarter — whether the customer `joined`, `stayed`, or `churned`.

An additional dataset with estimated population data for various California zip codes was also utilized to enhance geographic feature insights. The primary objective is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict the future status of a customer based on the available features.
